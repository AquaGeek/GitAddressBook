# GitAddressBook

I tend to hang on to address book contacts far longer than I should. Keeping that data in Git gives me a safety net, should I ever need somebody's contact info (or old info) in the future.

The goal of this project is to create an OS X app that will automatically dump the address book's contents into vCards managed by Git.
